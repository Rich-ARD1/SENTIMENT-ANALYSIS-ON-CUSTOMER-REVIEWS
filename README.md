This project explores customer sentiment analysis using a sample dataset of reviews. 
The code utilizes Python libraries like Pandas, NLTK, Seaborn, and matplotlib to perform data cleaning, visualization, and basic text processing.

Data Exploration and Cleaning:

The code imports the libraries and reads the CSV data into a Pandas DataFrame.
It checks for missing values and drops any rows with missing data.
The initial column containing all text data is split into separate columns for "Text," "Sentiment," "Source," etc.
Data Visualization and Analysis:

Sentiment distribution is visualized using a bar chart, highlighting the proportion of positive and negative reviews.
The code analyzes the distribution of reviews across different sources using a countplot with color-coded sentiment.
Average confidence scores for each source are calculated and visualized with a bar chart.
Another countplot depicts the distribution of sentiment across different locations mentioned in the reviews.
Pie and bar charts showcase the overall sentiment distribution and review sources, respectively.
Text Preprocessing:

NLTK libraries are downloaded for text processing tasks.
Text pre-processing includes tokenization, converting text to lowercase, removing punctuation and stop words.
Bag-of-Words Model :

This section demonstrates a basic Bag-of-Words (BoW) model using CountVectorizer.
It preprocesses a limited sample of sentences (sentences 1 to 6) for illustration purposes.
The code creates a vocabulary of unique words and transforms preprocessed text into a BoW matrix.
Word frequencies are calculated from the BoW matrix and displayed as a dictionary.
Note:

This code provides a basic framework for sentiment analysis. Further steps could involve:

Implementing more advanced text processing techniques (e.g., stemming, lemmatization)
Building machine learning models for sentiment classification
Analyzing specific keywords and phrases associated with positive and negative sentiments
Business Impact:

Sentiment analysis of customer reviews offers valuable insights for businesses. By understanding customer sentiment, businesses can:

Identify areas for improvement in products, services, and customer interactions.
Address negative feedback and take steps to improve customer satisfaction.
Analyze trends in customer sentiment over time and adapt strategies accordingly.
Prioritize resources based on areas with the most significant impact on customer sentiment.
Craft targeted marketing campaigns based on positive sentiment towards specific products or features.
By leveraging this data, businesses can gain a competitive edge by proactively addressing customer concerns and enhancing their overall customer experience.
